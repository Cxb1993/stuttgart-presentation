The framework supports stochastic formation of new bonds, breakage of existing bonds, and conversion between bond types. Bond formation can be controlled to limit the maximal functionality of a bead with respect to various bond types. Concomitant with the bond dynamics, angular and dihedral interactions are dynamically introduced between newly connected triplets and quartets of beads, where the interaction type is determined from the local pattern of bead and bond types. When breaking bonds, all angular and dihedral interactions involving broken bonds are removed. The framework allows chemical reactions to be modeled, and use it to simulate a simplistic, coarse-grained {DNA} model. The resulting {DNA} dynamics illustrates the power of the present framework.

	abstract = {The growth of a vapor bubble in a superheated liquid is controlled by three factors: the inertia of the liquid, the surface tension, and the vapor pressure. As the bubble grows, evaporation takes place at the bubble boundary, and the temperature and vapor pressure in the bubble are thereby decreased. The heat inflow requirement of evaporation, however, depends on the rate of bubble growth, so that the dynamic problem is linked with a heat diffusion problem. Since the heat diffusion problem has been solved, a quantitative formulation of the dynamic problem can be given. A solution for the radius of the vapor bubble as a function of time is obtained which is valid for sufficiently large radius. This asymptotic solution covers the range of physical interest since the radius at which it becomes valid is near the lower limit of experimental observation. It shows the strong effect of heat diffusion on the rate of bubble growth. Comparison of the predicted radius‐time behavior is made with experimental observations in superheated water, and very good agreement is found.},

Such commercial activities have prompted further fundamental research interest in fluid and bubble dynamics, transport phenomena and the scale up effects of three-phase fluidization systems. The fundamental behavior of particular relevance to these activities is associated with the elevated temperature and pressure conditions. This review attempts to summarize the salient characteristics of liquid, bubbles, and particles and their interactive behavior and dynamics in the process of bubble formation and bubble rising in gas–liquid–solid fluidization systems. Measurement techniques including both intrusive techniques such as the probes, and non-intrusive techniques such as tomography, that are used to study fluid and bubble properties in gas–liquid and gas–liquid–solid systems, are illustrated. Governing mechanisms of bubble–particle collision and bubble breakup are discussed. The state-of-the-art computational techniques, that consider both the discrete and the continuum approaches for movement of the particle and bubble phases along with the discrete simulation results, are presented. Of particular emphasis is the effect of pressure and temperature on the fluid and bubble dynamics in three-phase fluidization.},

	abstract = {We present a patch code for {LAMMPS} to implement a coarse grained ({CG)} model of poly(vinyl alcohol) ({PVA).} {LAMMPS} is a powerful molecular dynamics ({MD)} simulator developed at Sandia National Laboratories. Our patch code implements tabulated angular potential and Lennard-Jones-9-6 ({LJ96)} style interaction for {PVA.} Benefited from the excellent parallel efficiency of {LAMMPS}, our patch code is suitable for large-scale simulations. This {CG-PVA} code is used to study polymer crystallization, which is a long-standing unsolved problem in polymer physics. By using parallel computing, cooling and heating processes for long chains are simulated. The results show that chain-folded structures resembling the lamellae of polymer crystals are formed during the cooling process. The evolution of the static structure factor during the crystallization transition indicates that long-range density order appears before local crystalline packing. This is consistent with some experimental observations by small/wide angle X-ray scattering ({SAXS/WAXS).} During the heating process, it is found that the crystalline regions are still growing until they are fully melted, which can be confirmed by the evolution both of the static structure factor and average stem length formed by the chains. This two-stage behavior indicates that melting of polymer crystals is far from thermodynamic equilibrium. Our results concur with various experiments. It is the first time that such growth/reorganization behavior is clearly observed by {MD} simulations. Our code can be easily used to model other type of polymers by providing a file containing the tabulated angle potential data and a set of appropriate parameters.

The force balance of a bubble attached to the heater includes the capillary adhesion force that involves the contact angle. From the theoretical point of view, the microscopic value of the contact angle should be used in this expression. However in the experimental literature on the bubble departure, the apparent contact angle is commonly used instead. This usually leads to a substantial increase of the bubble adhesion and provides a good agreement with experimental data. A theoretical justification for such a substitution is proposed. The difference between the effective capillary adhesion force (that involving the apparent contact angle) and its true value is provided by the hydrodynamic stress caused by the liquid flow towards the contact line which is also at the origin of the difference between the microscopic and apparent contact angles.},

	abstract = {Thermal management has become a critical issue for high heat flux electronics and energy systems. Integrated two-phase microchannel liquid-cooling technology has been envisioned as a promising solution, but with great challenges in flow instability. In this work, silicon nanowires were synthesized in situ in parallel silicon microchannel arrays for the first time to suppress the flow instability and to augment flow boiling heat transfer. Significant enhancement in flow boiling heat transfer performance was demonstrated for the nanowire-coated microchannel heat sink, such as an early onset of nucleate boiling, a delayed onset of flow oscillation, suppressed oscillating amplitudes of temperature and pressure drop, and an increased heat transfer coefficient.},

	abstract = {Flow boiling of water across a bank of circular staggered micro-pin fins, 250 μm long and 100 μm diameter with pitch-to-diameter ratio of 1.5, was experimentally studied for mass fluxes ranging from 346 kg/m2 s to 794 kg/m2 s and surface heat fluxes ranging from 20 W/cm2 to 350 W/cm2. Local temperature measurements were used to elucidate the two-phase heat transfer coefficients. The flow was visualized and classified as vapor slug and annular flow patterns. A flow map was constructed and compared with maps for adiabatic micro-scale systems and good agreement was observed. A superposition model for the two-phase heat transfer coefficient in convective boiling regime was developed. Frictional multiplier, ( ( ϕ l ) 2 ), from micro-scale studies was used to define the enhancement factor (F) in the heat transfer coefficient model and reasonable agreement was obtained between experiments and predictions.},

These inverters involve a number of insulated-gate bipolar transistors ({IGBTs)}, which are used as on/off switches. The heat dissipated in these transistors can result in heat fluxes of up to 200 W/cm2, which makes the thermal management problem quite important. In this paper, turbulent jet impingement involving nucleate boiling is explored numerically. The framework for these computations is the {CFD} code {FLUENT.} For nucleate boiling, the Eulerian multiphase model is used. The numerical results for boiling water and R113 jets (submerged) are validated against existing experimental data in the literature. Some representative {IGBT} package simulations that use R134a as the cooling fluid are also presented.},

The first fix, {FixGFC}, measures the elastic stiffness coefficients for a (small) solid block of a given material by making use of the fluctuation–dissipation theorem. With the help of the second fix, {FixGFMD}, the coefficients obtained from {FixGFC} can then be used to compute the elastic forces for a (large) block of the same material. Both fixes are designed to be run in parallel and to exploit the functions provided by {LAMMPS.} Program summary Program title: {FixGFC/FixGFMD} Catalogue identifier: {AECW\_v1\_0} Program summary {URL:} {http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/AECW\_v1\_0.html} Program obtainable from: {CPC} Program Library, Queen's University, Belfast, N.

Green's function molecular dynamics ({GFMD)} incorporates the full elastic response of semi-infinite solids so that only surface atoms have to be considered in molecular dynamics simulations, thus reducing the problem from three dimensions to two dimensions without compromising the physical essence of the problem. Solution method: See {“Nature} of problem”. Restrictions: The mean equilibrium positions of the {GFMD} surface atoms must be in a plane and be periodic in the plane, so that the Born–von Karman boundary condition can be used. In addition, only deformation within the harmonic regime is expected in the surface layer during Green's function molecular dynamics. Running time: {FixGFC} varies from minutes to days, depending on the system size, the numbers of processors used, and the complexity of the force field. {FixGFMD} varies from seconds to days depending on the system size and numbers of processors used.

In this paper, we present a continuation of previous work implementing algorithms for using accelerators into the {LAMMPS} molecular dynamics software for distributed memory parallel hybrid machines. In our previous work, we focused on acceleration for short-range models with an approach intended to harness the processing power of both the accelerator and (multi-core) {CPUs.} To augment the existing implementations, we present an efficient implementation of long-range electrostatic force calculation for molecular dynamics. Specifically, we present an implementation of the particle–particle particle-mesh method based on the work by Harvey and De Fabritiis. We present benchmark results on the Keeneland {InfiniBand} {GPU} cluster. We provide a performance comparison of the same kernels compiled with both {CUDA} and {OpenCL.} We discuss limitations to parallel efficiency and future directions for improving performance on hybrid or heterogeneous computers.},

The simulation covers the entire range of orifice inclination, starting from upward facing (0°) to downward facing (180°) orientation for a moderate air flow (30 cm3/s). Bubble at the orifice mouth becomes asymmetric as the plate gets tilted. The asymmetry maximizes at vertical orientation but with downward facing orifices symmetry restores. The local hydrodynamic structure reveals that the internal circulation cells in bubble become stronger as the inclination increases making the growing bubble asymmetric. Interestingly, bubble volume for downward facing orifice is 4.75 times higher than the bubble released at upward facing orifice. Observations from the present simulations suggest that bubble frequency and shape can be controlled by allowing appropriate inclination in the orifice mouth. © 2012 American Institute of Chemical Engineers {AIChE} J, 2012},

Discontinuities in the physical properties along the interface are taken care using appropriate smoothening functions. Surface tension at the interfacial plane is also added in the momentum equation to track the evolution of the bubbles. To prevent abrupt intrusion of one fluid into the other no penetration force is applied for two closely situated particles of different properties. Solid walls are modelled with two layer of virtual particle along the boundary. Further, the use of corrective form of kernel approximation eradicates the inherent particle deficiency at the interface and solid boundary. The model is capable to simulate the growth of the bubble, neck formation and its detachment from the orifice along with the dynamic velocity field in both the phases. Comparison between the numerical bubble contour and published results shows excellent predictability of the model. The volume of the bubble at the detachment and the bubble frequency are compared satisfactorily with available experimental observations.},

Continuum thermodynamic ideas are used to help identify the bubble interface and separate particles that constitute the vapor bubble and bulk liquid regions respectively. Using this idea, the density variation is found to vary smoothly from the liquid to vapor regions in the system.

	abstract = {The free energy based multiphase lattice Boltzmann method was used to directly simulate nucleate pool boiling. The interface capturing and energy equations with a phase change model were implemented into the isothermal lattice Boltzmann method. In order to validate the method, a bubble growth in a superheated liquid was simulated and compared to analytical solutions. Bubble departure diameter is dependent on gravity force, surface tension, contact angle, and wall superheat. Varying these parameters, numerical simulations were executed and the results were found to be in good agreement with the previous correlations. For a single nucleation site, the bubble growth on and departure from a superheated wall were simulated successfully. The vapor bubble shape and temperature fields were then compared to the experimental measurements. Also, for multiple nucleation sites, simulations were performed and their subsequent results are presented. The heat transfer rates of these simulations were calculated and compared to the empirical correlations for the nucleate pool boiling. Consequently, the multiphase lattice Boltzmann method with a phase change model is feasible for the direct numerical simulation of nucleate pool boiling.},

This extended method (Two-Fluid {MPS:} {TF-MPS)} was successfully applied to a subcooled boiling experiment. The most important element in any effective subcooled boiling model is to be able to accurately calculate where significant void fraction appears, that is, the location of the void departure point. The location of the initial void ejection into the subcooled liquid core can be determined fairly well experimentally and conventionally is given in terms of a critical subcooling.

A set of moving particles was used to represent the liquid phase. The bubble–liquid interface was set to be a free surface boundary which can be captured according to the motion and location of interfacial particles. The interfacial heat transfer rate was determined by the energy variety of interfacial particles. The bulk liquid velocities investigated ranged from 0.07 to 0.3 m/s. The surface orientations varied from vertical to horizontal through 60°, 45° and 30°. Bulk liquid subcooling varied from 0 to 6.5 {°C} and wall superheat from 2.0 to 20.0 {°C.} The computational results show that the bulk liquid velocity and surface orientation influenced the bubble diameter and liftoff time. Bubble would slide along the heater surface before lifting off and the sliding velocity at liftoff increased with an increase in bulk liquid velocity. Bubble dynamic was related to bulk liquid subcooling as well as wall superheat. The numerical results have been compared with the experimental data.},

The focus of the paper is on continuum methods where it covers the three common approaches in the sharp interface limit, namely the volume-of-fluid method with interface reconstruction, the level set method and the front tracking method, as well as methods with finite interface thickness such as color-function based methods and the phase-field method. Variants of the mesoscopic lattice Boltzmann method for two-fluid flows are also discussed, as well as various hybrid approaches. The mathematical foundation of each method is given and its specific advantages and limitations are highlighted. For continuum methods, the coupling of the interface evolution equation with the single-field {Navier–Stokes} equations and related issues are discussed. Methods and models for surface tension forces, contact lines, heat and mass transfer and phase change are presented. In the second part of this article applications of the methods in microfluidics and micro process engineering are reviewed, including flow hydrodynamics (separated and segmented flow, bubble and drop formation, breakup and coalescence), heat and mass transfer (with and without chemical reactions), mixing and dispersion, Marangoni flows and surfactants, and boiling.},

To this end, the current research put forth a dynamical boiling model. The model dynamically integrates the sub-processes associated with a boiling cycle, including those of the formation of a thermal boundary layer, the evaporation of a sublayer film, the growth and detachment of a bubble as well as the concomitant heat transfer. In the bubble growth period the growth rate is given by summing the evaporation over the vapor-liquid interface surrounded by a micro sublayer film, a macro film in the thermal boundary layer, and bulk fluid respectively. The computation solves transient governing equations for the instantaneous distribution and heat transfer of the micro sublayer film. It also works out automatically an apparent contact angle. The bubble detachment is processed in a new way that calculates the various forces acting on the bubble to trace the detaching process. Numerical results of the boiling from single nuclei agree with experimental data with reasonable accuracies. Comments are given about the possible improvement of the model and the further development toward practical hybrid simulations of the boiling phenomena.},

	abstract = {In the forthcoming second part of this paper a system of balance laws for a multi-phase mixture with many dispersed bubbles in liquid is derived where phase transition is taken into account. The exchange terms for mass, momentum and energy explicitly depend on evolution laws for total mass, radius and temperature of single bubbles. Therefore in the current paper we consider a single bubble of vapor and inert gas surrounded by the corresponding liquid phase. The creation of bubbles, e.g. by nucleation is not taken into account. We study the behavior of this bubble due to condensation and evaporation at the interface. The aim is to find evolution laws for total mass, radius and temperature of the bubble, which should be as simple as possible but consider all relevant physical effects. Special attention is given to the effects of surface tension and heat production on the bubble dynamics as well as the propagation of acoustic elastic waves by including slight compressibility of the liquid phase. Separately we study the influence of the three phenomena heat conduction, elastic waves and phase transition on the evolution of the bubble. We find ordinary differential equations that describe the bubble dynamics. It turns out that the elastic waves in the liquid are of greatest importance to the dynamics of the bubble radius. The phase transition has a strong influence on the evolution of the temperature, in particular at the interface. Furthermore the phase transition leads to a drastic change of the water content in the bubble. It is shown that a rebounding bubble is only possible, if it contains in addition an inert gas. In Part 2 of the current paper the equations derived are sought in order to close the system of equations for multi-phase mixture balance laws for dispersed bubbles in liquids involving phase change.},

For system 1, a computational scheme is conceived to describe the three-dimensional (3-D) bubble dynamics in gas–liquid bubble columns and gas–liquid–solid fluidized beds. This scheme is utilized to simulate the motion of the gas, liquid, and solid phases, respectively, based on the level-set interface tracking method, the locally averaged time-dependent {Navier–Stokes} equations coupled with the Smagorinsky subgrid scale stress model, and the Lagrangian particle motion equations. For system 2, the hydrodynamics and heat-transfer phenomena of a liquid droplet in motion and during the impact process with a hot flat surface, as well as with a particle, are illustrated. The 3-D level-set method is used to portray the droplet surface deformation whilst in motion and during the impact process. The {IBM} is employed so that the particle–fluid boundary conditions are satisfied. The governing equations for the droplet and the surrounding gas phase are solved utilizing the finite volume method with the Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian ({ALE)} technique. To account for the multiscale effect due to lubrication-resistance induced by the vapor layer between the droplet and solid surface or solid particle formed by the film-boiling evaporation, a vapor-flow model is developed to calculate the pressure and velocity distributions along the vapor layer. The temperature fields in all phases and the local evaporation rate on the droplet surface are illustrated using a full-field heat-transfer model.},

	abstract = {This Part {II} of the paper reports the three-dimensional (3-D) numerical modelling on bubbly flow in confined mini-/micro-channels using the volume of fluid ({VOF)} method in commercial {CFD} code {FLUENT.} The numerical simulation aims to provide detailed information of the fields of velocity, temperature and pressure so as to further understand the effect of bubble growth on the flow field and heat transfer from the channel wall. In Part I, the experiment of flow boiling in a mini-/micro-channel of rectangular cross-section was carried out and a simple one-dimensional (1-D) model for the interaction of the pressure fluctuations during the growth of a confined bubble with various kinds of upstream compressibility was developed as an aid to the rational specification of inlet resistance. In Part {II}, the experimental observers and the theoretical model developed in Part I are tested by performing the 3-D numerical simulation of bubble growth from nucleation to full confinement. The simulation involves some approximations based on a concept of pseudo-boiling to avoid the well-known difficulties of modelling bubble generation and growth. During the simulation, the volumetric growth rate of the bubble is defined to match the experimental observations. At small times prior to bubble detachment, a vapour flow was injected through a small hole in the wall to simulate nucleation. Following partial confinement, vapour injection was stopped and growth was driven by the generation of vapour at a defined rate at the contact area between the bubble and the superheated wall. The 3-D simulation reproduces the experimental observations of the distorted profile of the bubble and its trajectory during partially confined growth and provides information about flow and heat transfer in the bulk liquid outside the thin film region. The 3-D and 1-D predictions of the development of axial pressure distributions during partially and fully confined growth are in satisfactory agreement.},

	abstract = {In 1756, Leidenfrost observed that water drops skittered on a sufficiently hot skillet, owing to levitation by an evaporative vapour film. Such films are stable only when the hot surface is above a critical temperature, and are a central phenomenon in boiling. In this so-called Leidenfrost regime, the low thermal conductivity of the vapour layer inhibits heat transfer between the hot surface and the liquid. When the temperature of the cooling surface drops below the critical temperature, the vapour film collapses and the system enters a nucleate-boiling regime, which can result in vapour explosions that are particularly detrimental in certain contexts, such as in nuclear power plants. The presence of these vapour films can also reduce liquid–solid drag. Here we show how vapour film collapse can be completely suppressed at textured superhydrophobic surfaces. At a smooth hydrophobic surface, the vapour film still collapses on cooling, albeit at a reduced critical temperature, and the system switches explosively to nucleate boiling. In contrast, at textured, superhydrophobic surfaces, the vapour layer gradually relaxes until the surface is completely cooled, without exhibiting a nucleate-boiling phase. This result demonstrates that topological texture on superhydrophobic materials is critical in stabilizing the vapour layer and thus in controlling—by heat transfer—the liquid–gas phase transition at hot surfaces. This concept can potentially be applied to control other phase transitions, such as ice or frost formation, and to the design of low-drag surfaces at which the vapour phase is stabilized in the grooves of textures without heating.},

The interferometric measurement results indicated variations in the macroscopic thermal field around the isolated boiling bubble, such as development of a superheated liquid layer on the heating wall, swelling of the superheated liquid layer in the bubble growth process, hot wake accompanied by a rising bubble, and thermal boundary layer around the bubble indicating condensation in subcooled boiling. However, the interferometry could not detect the positive temperature gradient driving the evaporation near the liquid-vapor interface during the bubble growth process, because the spatial resolution of about thirty microns was insufficient. The thickness of the boundary layer driving the evaporation was estimated to be a few dozen microns by a two-dimensional heat transfer simulation with the experimental results as calculation conditions. Finally, an improvement plan of the high-speed interferometer based on the result of the heat transfer analysis was presented.},

This work focuses on analyzing the effects of surface tension on the growth rate for the thermally controlled stage of a single bubble in such a liquid. The conservation of energy equations, including the internal energy term for the bubble and that within boundary layer around it, are numerically solved. The complete temporal variations of the bubble in water and liquid nitrogen are investigated based on the assumption that the bubble growth is controlled only in sequence by inertia and heat. Thus, the two stages are subject to the continuity of the bubble growth, while the inertia-controlled stage is only formulated by the well-known Rayleigh solution. The thickness of the boundary layer around the bubble is also determined. The results are comparable with the Plesset-Zwick models and Forster-Zuber models, as well as available experimental data. It is found that the influence of internal energy on the rate of bubble growth is small enough to be ignored; however, the accumulative effects of the surface tension are significant and increase with a decrease in the degree of superheat.},

	abstract = {In the present study, the bubble growth, departure and the following flow pattern evolution during flow boiling in the mini-tube were visualized and quantitatively investigated, along with the simultaneous measurement of the local heat transfer coefficient around a specified nucleation site. Liquid nitrogen was employed as the working fluid and the test section was a segment of vertically upward quartz glass tube with the inner diameter range of 1.3–1.5 mm, which was coated by a layer of transparent {ITO} film as the heater on the outer surface. The growth rates of bubbles had similar and constant growth rate in two periods of time, i.e., before and after the bubbles departing from the nucleation site, which indicated the bubble growth was primarily governed by the inertial force. The bubble departure diameter and bubble period were investigated and the corresponding correlation was obtained based on the experimental data, which showed that the tube size of the mini-tube had no notable effect on the bubble departure and the trend of the bubble departure was similar to that in macro-tubes. Whereas the following flow pattern evolution was apparently confined due to the size effect, which presented desirable heat transfer performance in mini-tubes. The heat transfer coefficients for different flow patterns along the mini-tube were obtained in terms of bubbly, slug, annular flow and the flow regimes of flow reversal and post dryout. It was found that the dominant heat transfer mechanism was the liquid film evaporation which offered desirable heat transfer capability. The heat transfer performance would be deteriorated in the post dryout regime, while flow reversal could somewhat enhance the heat transfer upstream of the nucleation site. Boiling curves around the specified nucleation site were recorded and analyzed based on the recorded flow patterns.},

Here, we report an experimental study of the dynamic and thermal behavior of bubbles generated at a single site, that is, a microcavity filled with alumina particles. The thermal process associated with the bubble departure from the isolated cavity, in particular, was shown to be different from that of macroscale boiling. The bubble departure diameter remains constant in a low superheat (or Jakob number) regime which is solely determined by the balance of interfacial tension and buoyancy. In addition, the bubble departure frequency increases along the bubble size as the substrate temperature rises. The further-increased frequency of bubbles emerging from the cavity causes multiple bubbles to coalesce before the preceding bubble completely detaches from the substrate, thus, leading to the decrease of apparent departure frequency with the increase of substrate temperature.},

Emphasis is put on a clear distinction of the different velocities at the interface which appear due to phase transfer. The one-field model is solved numerically within a Finite Volume scheme and the interface is captured using an extended Volume of Fluid method, where the interface is reconstructed linearly with the {PLIC} technique. The numerical heat transfer is based on a two-scalar approach where two separate temperature fields are used for the temperature inside the two phases. This results in an accurate treatment of the interfacial heat transfer, specifically the interface temperature which is crucial numerically, both for evaporation and thermocapillarity. The method is validated for two-phase heat conduction, with analytical solution in case of no evaporation and with experimental measurement in case of incorporated evaporation effect. The method is applied to realistic cases dealing with non-uniformly heated thin liquid films, i.e. liquid films on (i) structured heated substrates and (ii) locally heated substrates. The numerical predictions in terms of flow pattern, surface deformation, temperature and velocity are compared with experiments conducted at the Université Libre de Bruxelles for (i) and at the Technische Universität Darmstadt for (ii). Qualitative agreement is achieved and shows the potential of this approach to simulate thermocapillary flows with dynamically deformable interfaces combined with evaporation.},

	abstract = {Nucleate pool boiling experiments with constant wall temperatures were performed using R11 and R113 for saturated pool boiling conditions. A microscale heater array and Wheatstone bridge circuits were used to maintain a constant wall temperature condition and to obtain measurements with high temporal and spatial resolution. Accurate heat flow rate data were obtained from microscale heater array by controlling the surface conditions at a high temporal resolution. Images of the bubble growth were captured using a high-speed {CCD} camera synchronized with the heat flow rate measurements. The geometry of the bubble was obtained from the images. In the asymptotic growth region, the bubble showed a growth rate that was proportional to t1/5, which was slower than the growth rate proposed in previous analytical analyses. The bubble growth behavior was analyzed using a new dimensionless parameter to permit comparisons with previous results at the same scale. The comparisons showed good agreement in the asymptotic growth region. A non-dimensional correlation for the bubble radius that can predict the bubble growth and the heat flow rate simultaneously, was suggested. The required heat flow rate for the volume change of the observed bubble was estimated to be larger than the instantaneous heat flow rate measured from the wall. Heat, other than the instantaneous heat supplied from the wall, is estimated to be transferred through the interface between bubble and liquid, even with saturated pool conditions. This phenomenon under a saturated pool condition needs to be analyzed and the data from this study can supply the good experimental data with the precise boundary condition (constant wall temperature).},

In order to predict the bubble detachment diameter, a theoretical model is proposed based on forces analysis in this paper. All the forces acting on a bubble are taken into account to establish a model for different flow boiling configurations, including narrow and conventional channels, upward, downward and horizontal flows. A correlation of bubble contact circle diameter is adopted in this study, and it is found that the bubble contact circle diameter has significant effect on bubble detachment. A new correlation taking the bubble contact circle diameter into account for the evaluation of bubble growth force is proposed in this study, and it is found that the bubble growth force and surface tension force are more significant in narrow channel when comparing with that in conventional channel. A visual experiment was carried out in order to verify present model; and the experimental data from published literature are used also. A good agreement between predicted and measured results is achieved.},

	abstract = {This article presents results for pool boiling heat transfer under microgravity conditions that the author and his team have gained in a succession of experiments during the past two decades. The objective of the research work was to provide answers to the following questions: Is boiling an appropriate mechanism of heat transfer for space application? How do heat transfer and bubble dynamics behave without the influence of buoyancy, or more general, without the influence of external forces? Is microgravity a useful environment for investigating the complex mechanisms of boiling with the aim of gaining a better physical understanding? Various carrier systems that allow simulation of a microgravity environment could be used, such as drop towers, parabolic trajectories with {NASA's} aircraft {KC-135}, ballistic rockets such as {TEXUS}, and, more recently, three Space Shuttle missions. As far as the possibilities of the respective missions allowed, a systematic research program was followed that was continuously adjusted to actual new parameters. After a general survey concerning the importance of boiling for technical applications, an introduction is given especially for those individuals not closely familiar with the fields of microgravity and boiling. Surprising results have been obtained: not only that saturated pool boiling can be maintained in a microgravity environment, but also that at small heater surfaces and lower values of heat fluxes, even higher heat transfer coefficients have been attained than under terrestrial conditions. The bubble departure can be attributed to surface tension effects, to “bubble ripening” and coalescence processes. Under subcooled conditions only, thermocapillary flow was observed that transports the heat from the bubble interface into the bulk liquid, but does not enhance the heat transfer compared with boiling at saturated conditions. Direct electrical heated plane surfaces lead to a slow extension of dry spots to dry areas below bubbles, the increasing surface temperature suggesting transition to film boiling. The critical heat flux in microgravity is lower than under earth conditions, but considerably higher than the hitherto accepted correlations predict when extrapolated to microgravity. The nearly identical heat transfer coefficients received for nucleate boiling under microgravity as well as terrestrial conditions, and for both saturated and subcooled fluid states, also suggest identical heat transfer mechanisms. These results lead to the conclusion that the primary heat transfer mechanism must be strongly related to the development of the microlayer during bubble growth. Secondary mechanisms are responsible for the transport of enthalpy in form of latent energy of the bubbles and hot liquid carried with them. Under terrestrial conditions, that mechanism is caused by external forces such as buoyancy; under microgravity conditions, the self dynamics of the bubbles and/or thermocapillary flow under subcooled conditions are responsible. The results demonstrate clearly that boiling can be applied as a heat transfer mechanism in a microgravity environment and that microgravity is a useful means to study the physics of boiling.},

	abstract = {An evaporation model compatible with interface-capturing schemes for vapor–liquid flow is presented. The model formulation is largely independent of the specific realization of interface-capturing and relies on a continuum-field representation of the source terms implementable in a broad class of {CFD} models. In contrast to most other numerical methods for evaporating interfacial flows, the model incorporates an evaporation source-term derived from a physical relationship for the evaporation mass flux. It is shown that especially for microscale evaporation phenomena this implies significant deviations of the interface temperature from the saturation temperature. The mass source-term distribution is derived from the solution of an inhomogeneous Helmholtz equation that contains a free parameter allowing to tune the spatial localization of the source. The evaporation model is implemented into the volume-of-fluid scheme with piecewise linear interface construction. Results are obtained for three analytically or semi-analytically solvable model problems, the first two being one-dimensional Stefan problems, the third a free droplet evaporation problem. In addition, a two-dimensional film boiling problem is considered. Overall, the comparison between the {CFD} and the (semi)-analytical models shows good agreement. Deviations exist where convective heat transfer due to spurious currents is no longer negligible compared to heat conduction. With regard to the film boiling problem, a similar evaporation pattern as recently identified using a level-set method is found. A major advantage of the developed evaporation model is that it does not refer to intrinsic details of the interface-capturing scheme, but relies on continuum-field quantities that can be computed by virtually any {CFD} approach.},

	abstract = {During the period of {March–May} 2011, a series of boiling experiments was carried out in the Boiling Experimental Facility ({BXF)} located in the Microgravity Science Glovebox ({MSG)} of the International Space Station ({ISS).} The {BXF} Facility was carried to {ISS} on Space Shuttle Mission {STS–133} on February 24, 2011. Nucleate Pool Boiling Experiment ({NPBX)} was one of the two experiments housed in the {BXF.} Results of experiments on single bubble dynamics (e.g., inception and growth), multiple bubble dynamics (lateral merger and departure, if any), nucleate pool boiling heat transfer, and critical heat flux are described. In the experiments Perfluoro-n-hexane was used as the test liquid. The system pressure was varied from 51 to 243 {kPa}, pool temperature was varied from 30° to {59°C}, and test surface temperature was varied from 40° to {80°C.} The test surface was a polished aluminum disc (1 mm thick, 89.5 mm in diameter) heated from below with strain gage heaters. Five cylindrical cavities were formed on the surface with four cavities located at the corners of a square and one in the middle. During experiments the magnitude of mean gravity level normal to the heater surface varied from 1.2 × 10 − 7g e to 6 × 10 − 7g e . The results of the experiments show that a single bubble continues to grow to occupy the size of the chamber without departing from the heater surface. During lateral merger of bubbles, at high superheats a large bubble may lift off from the surface but continues to hover near the surface. Neighboring bubbles are continuously pulled into the large bubble. At low superheats bubbles at neighboring sites simply merge to yield a larger bubble. The larger bubble mostly locates in the middle of the heated surface and serves as a vapor sink. The latter mode continues to persist when boiling is occurring all over the heater surface. Heat fluxes for steady state nucleate boiling and critical heat fluxes are found to be much lower than those obtained under earth normal gravity conditions. The data are useful for calibration of results of numerical simulations. Any correlations that are developed for nucleate boiling heat transfer under microgravity condition must account for the existence of vapor escape path (sink) from the heater, size of the heater, and the size and geometry of the chamber.},

The test sections are single-side heated and have a projected heating surface of 12.25 × 100 mm. Subcooled flow boiling heat transfer results were obtained from onset of nucleate boiling to critical heat flux and film boiling under conditions of inlet subcooling range from 10 {°C} to 30 {°C}, outlet pressure range from 0.4 to 0.8 {MPa} and mass flow rate range from 124 to 372 kg/m2 s. The data of bubble growth, bubble departure size, nucleation distribution are measured. Nucleation distribution has an exponential relationship with uniform heat flux under moderate and high heat flux in subcooled flow boiling. The high nucleation density results in liquid supply shortage for nucleation and local dryout, which possibly initiates {CHF.} The visualization data did not show significant difference in hypervapotron structure with respect to bubble growth, departure and nucleation distribution, although hypervapotron delivers 40–50\% higher {CHF} under same thermohydraulic conditions.},

However, due to the complexity involved in modeling continuously evolving vapor–liquid interfaces, unrealistic assumptions are often made in developing various models. With the advances of recent years in the area of computational science and engineering, it is now possible to solve, completely, the conservation equations of mass, momentum, and energy for liquid and vapor phases simultaneously when an interface is continuously evolving at and near a heated surface. The solutions provide not only detailed physics of associated thermal and hydrodynamic processes, but also the shape of the evolving interface. In demonstrating the application of numerical simulations as an effective tool, both pool nucleate and film boiling at normal earth gravity, and nucleate boiling under microgravity conditions are considered. Although these simulations have been computationally intensive, in the future calculations of this type are expected to become routine.},

	abstract = {A critical review of the state of the art of research on internal forced convection boiling in microchannels and in microgravity conditions is the main object of the present paper. In many industrial applications, two-phase flows are used for heavy-duty and reliable cooling and heating processes. The boiling phenomena are essential for evaporator heat exchangers, even in a very small scales, such as for {PC} cooling, refrigerators, {HVAC} systems. Even if the study of boiling is a standard research since a century, there are many aspects which are still under discussion, especially for forced convection boiling in small tubes. As the present review is pointing out, some literature results are still incongruous, giving critical uncertainties to the design engineers. The use of non-dimensional parameters is rather useful, but, especially in case of boiling, may provide an erroneous picture of the phenomena in quantitative and qualitative meaning. The idea to consider the channel microsize together with the microgravity effects in a single review is due to the fact that the transition between confined and unconfined bubble flows may be defined using dimensionless numbers, such as the Eötvös number Eo = g({ρL−ρV)L2/σ} and its analogs, which are at the same time linked to the tube diameter and the gravity forces. In fact the Eötvös number tends to zero either when the gravity tends to zero or when the tube diameter tends to zero, but physical phenomena appear different considering separately either only the tube size or only the microgravity condition. Since the global picture of such physical process in flow boiling remains unclear, we claim the necessity to define in the most complete way the status-of-the-art of such an important research field and critically investigate the successes and the weaknesses of the current scientific literature. Noteworthy, the distinction between a macroscale and a microscale regime is misleading, since it could bring to consider a drastical variation of the physical phenomena, which is in fact not occurring until extremely low values of the channel dimension. Instead there is a typical flow pattern, the confined bubble flow, which is the dominant flow mechanism in small channels and in microgravity. Furthermore the vapor quality is a very important parameter, whose role is not well described in the present pattern classification. The values and combinations of the dimensionless numbers at which such pattern appears is the main issue of the present researches. Noteworthy, the meaning of “micro” is here used, as in the present literature, in a broad meaning, not strictly linked to the actual size of the channel, but to a change of patterns (and other physical characteristics) linked to a given dimensionless scale.},

	abstract = {The growth of vapor bubbles is studied numerically in a microchannel with asymmetric surface features. The channel design is chosen such that evaporation results in vapor bubbles growing only along a predefined direction. The principle relies on capillary forces and the pinning/depinning of three-phase contact lines at sharp edges of the wall geometry. Analytical expressions are derived predicting the direction of bubble growth and allowing to assess the robustness of a specific channel geometry in terms of supporting unidirectional bubble growth. From these expressions design rules for microchannels incorporating geometrical parameters and the wall contact angle of the liquid phase can be derived. The numerical calculations are performed based on an extended Volume-of-Fluid method accounting for phase change. The results confirm that under specific conditions, vapor bubbles only expand in one direction, thereby corroborating the analytical model. The presented concept may find applications in designing microchannels for stabilized flow boiling or micropumps/-actuators relying on phase change.},

	abstract = {Three-dimensional multiphase flow and flow with phase change are simulated using a simplified method of tracking and reconstructing the phase interface. The new level contour reconstruction technique presented here enables front tracking methods to naturally, automatically, and robustly model the merging and breakup of interfaces in three-dimensional flows. The method is designed so that the phase surface is treated as a collection of physically linked but not logically connected surface elements. Eliminating the need to bookkeep logical connections between neighboring surface elements greatly simplifies the Lagrangian tracking of interfaces, particularly for {3D} flows exhibiting topology change. The motivation for this new method is the modeling of complex three-dimensional boiling flows where repeated merging and breakup are inherent features of the interface dynamics. Results of {3D} film boiling simulations with multiple interacting bubbles are presented. The capabilities of the new interface reconstruction method are also tested in a variety of two-phase flows without phase change. Three-dimensional simulations of bubble merging and droplet collision, coalescence, and breakup demonstrate the new method's ability to easily handle topology change by film rupture or filamentary breakup. Validation tests are conducted for drop oscillation and bubble rise. The susceptibility of the numerical method to parasitic currents is also thoroughly assessed.},

The equations are discretized by a finite difference method on a regular grid and the phase boundary is explicitly tracked by a moving front. A comparison of numerical results to the exact solution of a one-dimensional test problem shows excellent agreement. The method is applied to film boiling, where vapor bubbles are generated from a thin film next to a hot wall.

The method is based on writing one set of governing equations for the whole computational domain and treating the different phases as one fluid with variable material properties. Interfacial terms are accounted for by adding the appropriate sources as δ functions at the boundary separating the phases. The unsteady {Navier–Stokes} equations are solved by a conventional finite volume method on a fixed, structured grid and the interface, or front, is tracked explicitly by connected marker points. Interfacial source terms such as surface tension are computed on the front and transferred to the fixed grid. Advection of fluid properties such as density is done by following the motion of the front. The method has been implemented for fully three-dimensional flows, as well as for two-dimensional and axisymmetric ones. First, the method is described for the flow of two or more isothermal phases. The representation of the moving interface and its dynamic restructuring, as well as the transfer of information between the moving front and the fixed grid, are discussed. Applications and extensions of the method to homogeneous bubbly flows, atomization, flows with variable surface tension, solidification, and boiling are then presented.},

Such systems include a wide range of devices for computation, measurement, and actuation in environments that range from office space to outer space as well as living systems. This paper examines important processes that must be considered when channel diameters decrease, including flow distribution issues in single, parallel, and split flows; flow instability in parallel passages; manufacturing tolerance effects; single-phase heat transfer; nucleation processes; boiling heat transfer and pressure drop; and wall conductance effects.

This facilitated measurements of radial profiles for gas volume fraction, gas velocity, liquid temperature and bubble size. After reviewing the theoretical and experimental basis of correlations used in the model, give a careful assessment of the necessary recalibrations to describe the {DEBORA} tests. It is then shown that within a certain range of conditions different tests can be simulated with a single set of model parameters. As the subcooling is decreased and the amount of generated vapour increases the gas fraction profile changes from wall to core peaking. This is a major effect not captured by the present modelling.

This study presents optical coherence tomography ({OCT)} as a novel modality for three-dimensional and two-dimensional time resolved imaging of nucleate boiling on heated surfaces on a microscopic scale with high spatial (\&lt;10 μm) and temporal (\&gt;25 frames per second) resolution. Within this study, a borosilicate glass plate coated with an optically transparent and electrically conductive indium tin oxide ({ITO)} layer with a thickness of approximately 100 nm was used as heating surface. The combination of these two properties allows optical inspection of the nucleate boiling from the backside by {OCT} focused on the formation, growth and detachment of single bubbles. We demonstrated for the first time that {OCT} is an excellent tool to acquire two-dimensional and three-dimensional images of the base of vapor bubbles from the backside of the heated surface. The acquired images allow for instance the temporally resolved measurement of the bubble diameter, diameter of the bubble base and the contact angle. Exploiting the phase information of the acquired {OCT} signal stacks allows imaging the movement of the bubble surrounding fluid. We think that {OCT} will provide many new insights into the boiling phenomena at the bubble base. The recent enhancement of the acquisition rates of {OCT} systems will facilitate four-dimensional imaging of single bubble evaporation procedures in the nearer future.},

	abstract = {In the occasion of boiling heat transfer, system pressure has significant effects on the heat transfer characteristics through the impacts on bubble behaviors. In the applications such as nuclear engineering, refrigeration and thermal engineering, depending on the operating conditions, system pressure is the frequent altered parameter to change the work conditions of those facilities. In present work, a visualized study was carried out to investigate the bubble behavior in high subcooled flow boiling in a vertical rectangular narrow channel. Water was used as working fluid, and the system pressure, subcooling and heat flux ranged from 0.1 {MPa} to 1.0 {MPa}, 20 K–36 K and 50 {kW/m2} to 348 {kW/m2}, respectively. Bubble behavior in different working conditions were recorded by a high speed camera at the speed of 10,000 fps (frame per second). Experimental results show that the system pressure has a significant effect on bubble growth and detachment. Under lower pressure, the bubbles grow up at nucleate sites, and then collapse without sliding. However, the bubbles keep growing when sliding along the heating wall rather than collapsing under higher pressure. Sliding bubble growth rate has a significant effect on the sliding velocity and distance. With high sliding bubble growth rates, bubble sliding velocity is lower than the bulk velocity at the beginning, and then it would be higher than the bulk velocity gradually.

In the present experimental study, the bubble growth rate at 0.1 {MPa} was about 10 times of that at 1.0 {MPa.}},

	abstract = {The paper describes actual Computational Fluid Dynamics ({CFD)} approaches to subcooled boiling and investigates their capability to contribute to fuel assembly design. In a prototype version of the {CFD} code {CFX} a wall-boiling model is implemented based on a wall heat flux partition algorithm. It can be shown, that the wall boiling model is able to calculate the cross sectional averaged vapour volume fraction of vertical heated tubes tests with good agreement to published experimental data. The most sensitive parameters of the model are identified. Needs for more detailed experiments are established which are necessary to support further model development. The model is applied for investigation of the phenomena inside a hot channel of a fuel assembly. Here the essential phenomenon is the critical heat flux. Although subcooled boiling represents only a preliminary state towards the critical heat flux occurrence, essential parameters like swirl, cross flow between adjacent channels and concentration regions of bubbles can be determined. By calculating the temperature of the rod surface the critical regions can be identified which may later on lead to departure from nucleate boiling and possible damage of the fuel pin. The application of up-to-date {CFD} with a subcooled boiling model for the simulation of a hot channel enables the comparison and the evaluation of different geometrical designs of the spacer grids of a fuel rod bundle.},

Effect of the unit cell size W on the interface dynamics, heat transfer, and fluid flow is studied for different wall superheats. The simulations are carried out over sufficiently long times to capture several bubble release cycles and to evaluate the quasi steady-state Nusselt number 〈 Nu 〉 ¯ . While instantaneous Nusselt number will change as result of a change in the system size, statistically steady-state Nusselt number remains almost the same. Simulations of two-dimensional systems in large unit cells, 5λd2 \&lt; W \&lt; 10λd2, show a distribution of bubble spacing in the range of 0.61λd2–1.46λd2. At relatively low superheats (Ja ⩽ 0.064) the bubbles are released periodically from the vapor film, but at intermediate superheats (0.064 \&lt; Ja \&lt; 2.13) permanent vapor jets are formed with no bubble break off. At sufficiently high superheats, the vapor jets start to interact. It is shown that the average bubble spacing does not change with changes in the wall superheat.},

They suffer from flow instabilities and uneven distribution between channels that may cause local dryout and overheating. The current state of the art is reviewed critically. A simple 1-D model for bubble growth in a single channel with a compressible volume in its upstream plenum is developed as a tool for the rational design of measures known to reduce flow instabilities, namely inlet resistance and enhanced nucleation in every channel. The model considers two stages of partially and fully confined bubble growth in a single channel of rectangular cross-section, suggested by experimental observations, followed by venting of vapour to the downstream plenum. The experiments also show the influence of apparently minor changes in rig design and operation on upstream compressibility and flow reversal. The model considers upstream compressibility due to subcooled boiling in a preheater or trapped non-condensable gas and the reduction of flow reversal by inlet resistance. The feasibility of measuring transient axial variations in pressure within small channels using inexpensive transducers is demonstrated.},

Four different liquids are used as working fluids. The external wall of the micro-channel temperature is measured by an infra-red camera and the liquid interface is recorded using a high-speed camera. The results indicate, and consistently, that the evaporation rate increases with the applied power then peaks before declining. The measurements show that there is a maximum in evaporation rate as a function of applied power. Furthermore, a good correlation between the maximum in evaporation rate and the onset of instabilities of the interface is demonstrated. These instabilities, to our mind, are induced by an increasing temperature gradient along the micro-channel wall around the three phase contact line region. A theoretical model was developed to predict evaporation rate near the contact line region. The comparison between the model and experiments highlights the limitations of the microregion models in predicting evaporation rates.},

Although it has previously been shown to have a relatively limited effect on the accuracy of velocity and shape predictions in the case of large gas bubbles sliding under inclined walls (e.g. Cook and Behnia, 2001), it may have a more determining influence on the numerical prediction of the dynamics of smaller ellipsoidal bubbles which were shown by Tsao and Koch (1997) to bounce repeatedly when sliding under inclined walls at certain wall inclinations. The present paper reports on the influence of surface tension and the static contact angle on the dynamics of an ellipsoidal air bubble of equivalent diameter De = 3.4 mm. The bubble Eötvös and Morton numbers are Eo = 1.56 and Mo = 2 × 10−11 respectively. The computational results are achieved with a Piecewise Linear Construction ({PLIC)} of the interface and are reviewed with reference to experimental measurements of bubble velocity and interface shape oscillations recorded using a high speed digital camera. Tests are performed at plate inclination angles θ ∈ \{10°, 20°, 30°, 45°\} to the horizontal and computational models consider three static contact angles θc ∈ \{10°, 20°, 30°\}. The static contact angle has been found to have a significant effect on the bubble dynamics but to varying degree depending on the plate inclination. It is shown to promote lift off and bouncing when the plate inclination angle reaches 30° in a way that does not necessarily reflect experimental observations.},

Bubble deformation and thermal growth are investigated numerically by means of a three-dimensional volume-of-fluid method. Furthermore, the asymptotic case of nucleation in extremely superheated liquids is treated in the framework of a continuum theory based on the {Cahn–Hilliard} gradient model. It is found that there is always an interesting distinction of the value π/4 for the flow-induced orientation angle in the case of small shear rates. For a great variety of viscosity and density ratios, the bubble deformation and even the break-up radius as a function of the corresponding capillary number are obtained. The growth process including non-equilibrium contributions is calculated, too. The results indicate that shear is able to completely suppress classical nucleation under certain circumstances.},

Interfaces of free surface and large bubbles are calculated directly by solving transport of a steep void fraction gradient corresponding to interface, while averaged behavior of microscopic dispersed bubbles and droplets are calculated in the two-fluid model scheme. It is expected that the present method can treat effects of significant kinetic interaction between the phases directly without empirical correlations. The calculated propagation of wet front in a dam break problem is close to experimental data. The predicted flow patterns of complex gas-liquid two-phase flow in a flat tube are quite similar to observations with a video camera.

An iterative procedure is used at the interface between the solid and fluid phases in order to match temperatures and heat fluxes. Time and space invariant heat fluxes are supplied at the solid base and calculations are carried out for solids with different thermo-physical properties and thicknesses. Near the three-phase contact line, temperatures in the solid are observed to fluctuate significantly over short periods as the bubble base first expands outwards then contracts inwards before departure. The results show that waiting and growth periods can be related directly to wall superheat. The functional relationship between waiting time and wall superheat is found to agree well with the correlations based on experimental data reported in the literature.},

Nonlinear data analysis techniques such as the dimension spectrum and largest Lyapunov exponent have been used for analysis of data recorded in experiment. It has been shown that properties of dynamics of nucleation sites changes nonlinearly together with changing the spacing between cavities. To explain appearance of such properties of nucleation sites interaction the simulation of gas bubble movement in the liquid in the last stage of bubble departures has been made with using the stabilized finite element method and level set method. It has been shown that the bubble departure velocities and structure of velocity field around the bubbles nonlinearly depend on the initial horizontal spacing between bubbles.

A subcell conception is introduced in a modified mass transfer model to accurately calculate the mass transfer across the interface. The third-order essentially nonoscillatory ({ENO)} scheme and second-order semi-implicit Crank-Nicholson scheme is employed to update the convective and diffusion terms, respectively. The projection method has second-order temporal accuracy for variable-density unsteady incompressible flows as well. The level set approach is employed to implicitly capture the interface for multiphase flows. A continuum surface force ({CSF)} tension model is used in the present cases. Phase change and dynamics associated with single bubble and multibubbles in two and three dimensions during nucleate boiling are studied numerically via the present modeling. The numerical results show that this method can handle complex deformation of the interface and account for the effect of liquid–vapor phase change.},

	abstract = {A phase-field model is developed for quantitative simulation of bubble growth in the diffusion-controlled regime. The model accounts for phase change and surface tension effects at the liquid-vapor interface of pure substances with large property contrast. The derivation of the model follows a two-fluid approach, where the diffuse interface is assumed to have an internal microstructure, defined by a sharp interface. Despite the fact that phases within the diffuse interface are considered to have their own velocities and pressures, an averaging procedure at the atomic scale, allows for expressing all the constitutive equations in terms of mixture quantities. From the averaging procedure and asymptotic analysis of the model, nonconventional terms appear in the energy and phase-field equations to compensate for the variation of the properties across the diffuse interface. Without these new terms, no convergence towards the sharp-interface model can be attained. The asymptotic analysis also revealed a very small thermal capillary length for real fluids, such as water, that makes impossible for conventional phase-field models to capture bubble growth in the millimeter range size. For instance, important phenomena such as bubble growth and detachment from a hot surface could not be simulated due to the large number of grids points required to resolve all the scales. Since the shape of the liquid-vapor interface is primarily controlled by the effects of an isotropic surface energy (surface tension), a solution involving the elimination of the curvature from the phase-field equation is devised. The elimination of the curvature from the phase-field equation changes the length scale dominating the phase change from the thermal capillary length to the thickness of the thermal boundary layer, which is several orders of magnitude larger. A detailed analysis of the phase-field equation revealed that a split of this equation into two independent parts is possible for system sizes ranging from micrometers and above. The split of the phase-field equation leads to two equations controlling independently the phase change and the shape of the phase-field profile across the diffuse interface. A new algorithm is presented to solve a fully coupled model, including advection, phase change, and surface tension effects. Good agreement is found among numerical simulations, analytical solutions, and experimental results.},

The particles track the interface directly and are embedded in the irregular grid by associating each tracking particle with a pair of grid nodes of different phases. This allows for a straightforward treatment of nodes that are subject to a change of phase. The conservation equation at the interface is solved explicitly at the location of the particles.

	abstract = {Three parallel algorithms for classical molecular dynamics are presented. The first assigns each processor a fixed subset of atoms; the second assigns each a fixed subset of inter-atomic forces to compute; the third assigns each a fixed spatial region. The algorithms are suitable for molecular dynamics models which can be difficult to parallelize efficiently—those with short-range forces where the neighbors of each atom change rapidly. They can be implemented on any distributed-memory parallel machine which allows for message-passing of data between independently executing processors. The algorithms are tested on a standard Lennard-Jones benchmark problem for system sizes ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel supercomputers--the {nCUBE} 2, Intel {iPSC/860} and Paragon, and Cray {T3D.} Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Cray Y-{MP} and C90 algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel machines is competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even for small problems. For large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves parallel efficiencies of 90\% and a 1840-node Intel Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Cray {C9O} processor. Trade-offs between the three algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more complex molecular dynamics simulations are also discussed.},

	abstract = {Physics-based fluid simulation has been widely used in manufacture and entertainment industry. However, numerically solving the three-dimensional incompressible fluid equation is an expensive computation task. Recently, the general purpose graphics hardware allows to speed up the numerical computations. To this end, we explore a new unified particle model on a multi-graphics processing unit ({GPU)} platform for interactive fluid simulation. In this paper, we present a parallel framework for fluid simulation with smoothed particle hydrodynamics. To begin with, we discuss the characteristics of storage dependence, data dependence, and decomposition method based on particles. And then, we design the computation model of simulation including kernel functions, adaptive time step, force, and pressure equations. The unified particle model not only ensures the mass and momentum conservation of simulation but also protects the volume of fluid and allows larger time steps, thus alleviating the calculation burden, contributing to the real-time simulation. Moreover, an effective parallel architecture based on the multi-{GPU} is implemented. For the fluid scene, the spatial domain is automatically partitioned into grid layers and assigned to multiple {GPUs} subsequently. A dynamic load balancing algorithm and an asynchronous data transferring strategy are proposed and implemented. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive density model for particle surface reconstruction. Finally, the quality and performance of the method are demonstrated using multiple scenes with different numbers of particle. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {The Moving Particle Semi-implicit ({MPS)} method is one of the particle methods in which continuum mechanics is analyzed using the concept of particles. Since meshes are not used, large deformation of free surfaces and material interfaces can be simulated without the problems of mesh distortion. Thus, the {MPS} method has been applied to multiphase flow analysis in nuclear engineering. The advantages of the particle methods are also useful for applications in other engineering fields: ship engineering, civil engineering, microflow, biomechanics, visualization, etc. In this review, calculation examples are described and classified. Commercial codes have been released and applied in industries. The particle methods are also used in {TV} programs, movies, and computer games. Combinations of numerical techniques for multiphysics problems, fast calculations, and high-quality visualizations are expected to lead to real-time particle simulations for various new applications in the near future.},

	abstract = {Flow boiling in microchannels has been investigated extensively over the past decade for electronics cooling applications; however, the implementation of microchannel heat sinks operating in the two-phase regime in practical applications has lagged due to the complexity of boiling phenomena at the microscale. This has led to difficulties in predicting the heat transfer rates that can be achieved as a function of the governing parameters. From extensive experimental work and analysis performed in recent years, a clear picture has emerged that promises to enable prediction of flow boiling heat transfer over a wide parameter space. Experiments have been conducted to determine the effects of important geometric parameters such as channel width, depth, and cross-sectional area, operating conditions such as mass flux, heat flux, and vapor quality, as well as fluid properties, on flow regimes, heat transfer coefficients, and pressure drops in microchannels. A detailed mapping of flow regimes occurring under different conditions has been facilitated with high-speed flow visualizations. In addition, quantitative criteria for the transition between macro- and microscale boiling behaviors have been identified. In this paper, these recent advances toward a comprehensive understanding of flow boiling in microchannels are summarized.},

Models based on these mechanisms contain fitting parameters that are used to fit them to the data, resulting a proliferation of “validated” models. A review of the recent experimental, analytical, and numerical work into single bubble heat transfer is presented to determine the contribution of each of the above mechanisms to the overall heat transfer. Transient conduction and microconvection are found to be the dominant heat transfer mechanisms. Heat transfer through the microlayer and at the three-phase contact line do not contribute more than about 25\% of the overall heat transfer.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a moving mesh, two-dimensional finite volume method suitable for tracking interfaces across which there is mass transfer. We consider liquid and vapor phases of single component fluids separated by a phase interface in an evolving flow field. Metastable bulk states are allowed (as are superheated vapor and subcooled liquid bulk states) while the interface is assumed to exist in thermal and chemical equilibrium. Mass transfer occurs at the interface, driven by the local flow conditions. The interface is tracked by nodes representing the liquid and vapor sides at the same spatial location. The interface motion is found from the solution of the coupled interfacial conditions and bulk fluid equations. The bulk fluids are considered as viscous, conducting, and compressible fluids necessitating the use of the continuity, momentum and energy equations in the bulk regions. The control volume continuity, momentum and energy equations are modified in the presence of a phase interface to include surface properties using a simple interface model with surface tension and surface energy. Simple simulations are presented illustrating the method.},
